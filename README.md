# ERC20 Token Creation Platform

This is an ERC20 token creation platform built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and ethers.js. The platform allows users to create various types of ERC20 tokens, including mintable, burnable, pausable, capped, and time-lock tokens, with a simple and intuitive web interface.

## Live Demo

## Features

- **Mintable Tokens**: Create tokens that can be minted by authorized addresses.
- **Burnable Tokens**: Create tokens that can be burned, reducing the total supply.
